#### Packages

Arch Linux users can install the theme from the AUR https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gtk-arc-flatabulous-theme-git/
	
#### Manual Installation

To build the theme the following packages are required
* `autoconf`
* `automake`
* `sassc` for GTK 3, Cinnamon, or GNOME Shell
* `pkg-config` or `pkgconfig` for Fedora
* `git` to clone the source directory
* `optipng` for GTK 2, GTK 3, or XFWM
* `inkscape` for GTK 2, GTK 3, or XFWM

The following packages are optionally required
* `gnome-shell`for auto-detecting the GNOME Shell version
* `libgtk-3-dev` for Debian based distros or `gtk3-devel` for RPM based distros, for auto-detecting the GTK3 version

**Note:** For distributions which don't ship separate development packages, just the GTK 3 package is needed instead of the `-dev` packages.

For the theme to function properly, install the following
* GNOME Shell 3.18 - 3.32, GTK 3.18 - 3.24
* The `gnome-themes-extra` package
* The murrine engine. This has different names depending on the distro.
  * `gtk-engine-murrine` (Arch Linux)
  * `gtk2-engines-murrine` (Debian, Ubuntu, elementary OS)
  * `gtk-murrine-engine` (Fedora)
  * `gtk2-engine-murrine` (openSUSE)
  * `gtk-engines-murrine` (Gentoo)

Install the theme with the following commands

    --with-custom=<script>         run the executable script file in the custom subfolder

After the installation is complete you can activate the theme with `gnome-tweak-tool` or a similar program by selecting `Arc-Flatabulous`, `Arc-Flatabulous-Darker` or `Arc-Flatabulous-Dark` as Window/GTK+ theme and `Arc-Flatabulous` or `Arc-Flatabulous-Dark` as Gnome-Shell and Xfce-Notify theme.

#### Arc-Dark for Ubuntu Software Center
The Arc Dark theme for the Ubuntu Software Center by [mervick](https://github.com/mervick) can be installed from [here](https://github.com/mervick/arc-dark-software-center). It solves readability issues with Arc Dark and the Ubuntu Software Center.

### Troubleshooting

If you use Ubuntu with a newer GTK/GNOME version than the one included by default (i.e Ubuntu 14.04 with GTK 3.14 or Ubuntu 15.04 with GTK 3.16, etc.) the prebuilt packages won't work properly and the theme has to be installed manually as described above.
This is also true for other distros with a different GTK/GNOME version than the one included by default

If you get artifacts like black or invisible backgrounds under Unity, disable overlay scrollbars with

    gsettings set com.canonical.desktop.interface scrollbar-mode normal
